##TLDR

This is a nodejs module to control I2C OLED display modules based
on SSD1306. I tested with [http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O2LLT30/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1].

Connected to my Edison with [https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13034], which
will save you a bit of soldering since you can hook it with jumpers.

This derives from the awesome [https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library](Adafruit Graphics)
though it has derived so far you may not notice.
